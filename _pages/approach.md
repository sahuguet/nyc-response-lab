Our approach is best summarized by the diagram below:

## Sourcing and identifying problems 
We establish and build relationships with community-based organizations and Business Improvement Districts (BIDs)

We workshop identified issues with our ecosystem partners to ensure a participatory project creation process 
	 
## Team formation 
We bring in partners who could offer relevant project resources by leveraging the Grid’s ecosystem of 130+ organizations in urban tech

## Data collection and analysis
We leverage the Response Lab’s consortium of academic partners and data scientists to source existing relevant data.

We partner with neighborhood associations to build a database of community-level insights informing community solution development.

## Solution building
We develop  user-friendly tools and platforms that directly address specific community needs

We build iterative solutions from ongoing community research, feedback, and data insights with the goal of creating tools that are both targeted to specific organization needs and scalable to wider communities

## Solution deployment
We implement solutions with hands-on training and understanding of how solutions interact with existing processes.

We monitor defined performance metrics and direct community feedback to  identify opportunities for continued solution improvements.


## Solution Scaling
We scale solutions to other neighborhoods in New York that would be ripe for implementation.

We hold knowledge sharing events such as roundtables to garner potential opportunities to scale to other cities in the US.

We adapt solutions as necessary to assimilate into other neighborhoods’ unique contexts and needs.
