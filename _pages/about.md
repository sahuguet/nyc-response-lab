In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, New Yorkers do what they do best, **respond**.

The "NYC Response Lab" creates innovative solutions to help New York City people/communities, businesses  and agencies recover from the COVID-19 crisis and be prepared for a second potential wave. 

# Who we work with
We work with local cummunities, business improvement districts (BIDs) and city agencies.

# What we do
* We source problems.
* We co-create, architect, build and deploy the solution.
* We bring external partners if needed.
* We hand-off the project.

# Why we are different
* We start bottom-up and not top-down.
* We start from problems, not products.
* We build, iterate, scale.
* We have a short, medium, and long-term thinking.
* We leverage [The Grid](https://edc.nyc/press-release/nycedc-and-civlab-launch-grid) ecosystem of 130+ orgs in urban tech
