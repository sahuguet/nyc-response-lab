This is an experiment.

This might become a way of replacing the Cornell Tech Wiki running on Confluence at [cornelltech.io/wiki](http://cornelltech.io/wiki).

The content is hosted on a **private** github repository at [https://github.com/cornelltech/intranet](https://github.com/cornelltech/intranet).

The content is served via a reverse-proxy using Cornell IT identity solution (this is the same authentication people use when accessing WorkDay).
